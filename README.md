Front end - Next js
Backend  - Node js, mongodb
Libraray - Pusher for 2 way communication


Steps to run this project
1. unzip project folder
2. open folder directory in terminal
3. Do npm install OR yarn install
4. start local server - yarn start-server OR  npm run start-server
5. start local client - yarn start-client OR npm run start-client


TODOS :
1. typescript
2. move secret keys to env file

KNOWN ERROR :
Forgot regular git commits to show my design thoughts.But I will try to explain my work below.
Since I haven't worked in Angualar much, picked react js fot this assignment.


Approaches :
1. Explored socket io,webrtc, pusbsub,pusher api approach. 
2. Since I haven't used any of it, going with pusher api because I found their documents and blogs more easy and helpful.
3. Looked for a solution if I could make this project without server, after some research realised server is needed.
Since I am not into backend dev, took a quick look into server and database design, and wrote a node js server and connecte it with Mongodb database
4. Doing this server work took more time than frontend but good learning up
5. Couldn't add typescript because of short of time.
6. TIME taken - 10 hours (Mostly because I have been doing frontend work for quite some time now, so I had to go back and learn some backend quickly)
7. I have added comments wherever I think this could not a ideal approach or optimal approach, some feeaback on this could really help me.


This assigment was a good new learning for me.
Thanks
